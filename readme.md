This is an application that logs into Handshake (https://app.joinhandshake.com/) a job board for students. It utilizes puppeteer with your information configured into your .env file to accomplish this. When configuring your .env file make sure you copy the url that you get **after** you apply for filters for the URL variable, so that when you log in your filters are preloaded.

I had originally planned to create a more complex application that auto-applied to every job posting with quick apply enabled, however I decided I'd take my time and apply to more positions I felt personally fit me.

Though the functionality of this app is very limited and not worth using without additional features, it was my introduction to web automation and to puppeteer so it was a great programming exercise!
